And here's my new partner - [Xiaomi's LCD writing tablet](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Writing-Electronic-Graphic-Drawing/dp/B08RCLW6TT/)!  
You can practice writing [Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) or [POC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) the critical step of any algorithm.

Anyways, it's an very funny gadget.
